# CyberSomm
## Virtual Sommelier Assistant

This is the website portal for the CyberSomm application. It demonstrates mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the purpose of developing a web app that will assist in the selection of wines to pair with food.

The site utilizes the Bootstrap 4 framework to assist with menus and CSS styling factors

The JavaScript logic for the sommelier function of the site is still currently a work in progress, and is just a demonstration of how the functionality for the selector buttons will work. Currently there are many wrong or dead ends within this logic that do not correspond to the selection chosen by the user.
