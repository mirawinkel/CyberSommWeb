# CyberSomm
## Virtual Sommelier Assistant

This is the website portal for the CyberSomm application. It demonstrates mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the purpose of developing a web app that will assist in the selection of wines to pair with food.

### HTML

The table function is utilized on the contact page.
The contact, login, and register pages all utilize forms.
There is a dropdown selector in the navigation bar to either select an option from the user pages (login or register) or also when the page is reduced in size enough the menu turns into a dropdown context menu.
The webfonts Sacramento and Montserrat are used throughout the site, and are imported in the style.css file.
There is an image on the index page, and an embedded video and gif on the About page.

### CSS

The site utilizes the Bootstrap 4 framework to assist with menus and CSS styling factors.

The login page features an internal stying sheet to show mastery of that deliverable.

Flexbox is utilized both through CSS and the bootstrap framework.

The tile at the bottom of the index page uses a fade in transformation to give some added drama.

### JavaScript
The site utilizes external JS files to operate all script functionality.

The fade in tile at the bottom of the index page utilizes "if" statement conditional, a loop, a function, event listeners and an array collection as shown on the app.js file. The somm.js file also utilizes callback functions built into event listeners.

The JavaScript logic for the sommelier function of the site is still currently a work in progress, and is just a demonstration of how the functionality for the selector buttons will work. Currently there are many wrong or dead ends within this logic that do not correspond to the selection chosen by the user.

### Additional
The site is constructed to run inside a SpringBoot application. The contact.html page utilizes some "thymeleaf" functionality to assist with the handling of the GET and POST requests to send the information as an email through the Java backend.
